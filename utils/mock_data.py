FTL offers faster delivery times and is more cost-effective for large, heavy shipments. Less-than-Truckload (LTL) shipping is when a shipment only occupies part of the truck's space, and the truck carries goods from multiple customers. LTL is ideal for smaller shipments that don't require a full truck. It can be more affordable for businesses but may take longer due to multiple stops and handling.",
